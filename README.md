# cms-api

## Motivation

When I develop my websites, I don't like limiting myself to ready-state templates. Moreover, I like to be free to use the any framework I want (Vue, React, Angular, Svelte, etc). These are a couple of many reasons I don't like WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, etc.

On the other hand, most of hosts have support to PHP and MySQL, and most of websites don't need a complex backend (PHP is doing a great work along years).

Then I decided to create a CMS detached from the frontend, an API based CMS, built with PHP and MySQL.

Here you'll find:

* Backend API built with PHP;
* CMS frontend built with VueJS, and totally detached from the backend (then you can create your own CMS frontend if you want);
* Example of a website built with HTML, Javascript and Bootstrap.

**Notes** 

* This is a very simple CMS, it's far from all resources WordPress has.
* It's under development, it's not usable yet.
* All suggestions are more than welcome.
